# WhatsAppOpener
As we know that Everyone uses Whatsapp in day to day life but there is one problem with it is that Whatsapp allows us to have the conversation only with those whose contact no. is saved in our mobile phones. If we want to send a document or any message without having the contact no. saved in our mobile phones we can't do that. so i have build this app which directly redirects you to the Whatsapp you just have to select the mobile no. writen anywhere ex- notes, dialer, browser, chats, messages, mails etc. it will show you the option to open the app and after clicking on it. it will redirect you to the  chat with that contact number on whatsapp
